Real-Time Collaboration Tool

A full-stack real-time collaboration platform built using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) with Socket.IO for real-time communication and Axios for API handling.
This tool enables multiple users to collaborate live, share documents, track changes with version control, and view comments history â€” all in real-time with a seamless and scalable experience.

Deployed on Vercel for fast and reliable access.

How It Works

WebSockets: When users join a room, they connect through Socket.IO channels.

Version Control: Every edit/save creates a new version entry in MongoDB.

Document Sharing: Users can generate a shareable link to collaborate with others.

Comments History: All comments are recorded, timestamped, and can be reviewed.

Authentication: Login/register flow with protected routes for authenticated sessions.

Synchronization: Real-time data sync using server-side events.
